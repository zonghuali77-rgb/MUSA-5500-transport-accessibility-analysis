# 1. Bus stops and boundary

![](../figures/nyc_bus_stops.png)

New York City contains **3,381 bus stops** distributed across its five boroughs.  
The spatial distribution in this map highlights several clear patterns:

- **Manhattan** exhibits the **highest point density**, with evenly spaced stops following the street grid.  
  This pattern reflects Manhattan’s extremely high block density and intensive surface transit demand.
- **Brooklyn and Queens** show wide coverage but with more irregular spacing, consistent with more diverse street networks and lower building density.
- **The Bronx** displays a moderate density of stops, particularly along major north–south corridors.
- **Staten Island** is much more sparsely served, aligned with its car-oriented development pattern.

These geographic differences already hint at variation in accessibility, later confirmed by the nearest-neighbour and KDE analysis.

# 2. 500 m coverage

![](../figures/nyc_coverage_500m.png)

Approximately **56.1% of New York City** lies within a **500 m walking distance** of a bus stop.  
Interpreting this map:

### Key insights
- Manhattan achieves **near-universal coverage**, especially below 110th Street.  
  The combination of narrow blocks and many parallel bus corridors makes almost the entire island fall within a 500 m radius.
- Brooklyn and Queens show **significant coverage gaps**, especially in low-density or industrial areas.
- Staten Island once again lags behind, with large residential zones beyond walkable bus access.

### Why does NYC not reach >70% coverage?
Even though stop density is relatively high, New York covers **a very large land area (1,362 km²)**.  
Large parks, airports, industrial areas, low-density districts, and waterfront zones reduce the overall coverage ratio.

# 3. Kernel density heatmap

![](../figures/nyc_kde_bw400.png)

The kernel density estimation (KDE) heatmap visually emphasises **intensity of bus stop clustering**, independent of administrative boundaries.

### Key spatial patterns
- The brightest concentration runs down the spine of **Manhattan**, reflecting the street grid’s dense transit corridors (e.g., Madison, Lexington, Broadway, 1st–5th Avenues).
- Other strong clusters appear in:
  - **Downtown Brooklyn & Brooklyn Heights**  
  - **Western Queens** (Astoria, Long Island City)  
  - **The Bronx South and West**

### Why does Manhattan stand out so strongly?
1. **Small block size** → more intersections → more stop placement opportunities  
2. **High population and job density** → need for very frequent bus service  
3. **Complementary to subway network** → bus feeders and crosstown routes fill subway gaps  
4. **Legacy streetcar routes** → many modern bus lines follow historic trolley lines

KDE complements the raw stop map by showing relative clustering intensity, whereas the 500 m coverage shows accessibility of land area.  
Together, these layers reveal both *where stops are* and *how intensively they are concentrated*.

# 4. Nearest-neighbour distances

![](../figures/nyc_nearest_neighbor.png)

Nearest-neighbour (NN) analysis quantifies how close the typical bus stop is to the next one.  
The distribution is heavily right-skewed:

### Statistics (from summary table)
- **Mean distance:** 183 m  
- **Median distance:** 108 m  
- **90th percentile:** 394 m  
- **Maximum:** > 2.4 km (mostly Staten Island or fringe industrial areas)

### Interpretation
- Most bus stops in NYC are **very close to each other (100–200 m)**.  
  This reflects high service frequency and redundancy in dense boroughs.
- The **long-tail** of the histogram represents isolated stops in low-density areas.
- Staten Island and parts of eastern Queens contribute disproportionately to the high-distance outliers.

### Spatial NN map interpretation
The right-hand map shows:
- **Dark purple** points (short NN distance) → Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn, LIC  
- **Green/yellow** points (long NN distance) → outer borough peripheries, Staten Island

NN distance complements KDE by quantifying spacing regularity; KDE identifies *clusters*, while NN identifies *local gaps*.

## 5. Manhattan bus network (high-density reference)

Manhattan’s bus map illustrates why it dominates NYC’s clustering patterns:

- Dozens of **north–south avenues** support parallel bus corridors.
- Frequent **crosstown routes** fill gaps between subway lines.
- The grid structure allows extremely consistent spacing of stops — often **every 2–3 blocks** (120–180 m), matching our calculated NN statistics.

This map visually reinforces the interpretation from all previous figures:  
**Manhattan is the core of NYC’s bus accessibility system**, both in density and coverage.
