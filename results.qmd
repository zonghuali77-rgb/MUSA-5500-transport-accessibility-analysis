# Comparative Stats

This section presents a cross-city comparison of bus stop density and 
walk-based accessibility indicators. While the underlying methods are 
consistent across all cities, interpretation must consider each city’s 
unique transit system design, land-use context, and service philosophy.

---

## 1. Bus stop density

The figure below compares bus stop density (stops per km²) across the 
four cities.

![](../figures/density_bar_chart.png)

### **Interpretation**

The four cities show substantial variation in bus stop density:

- **Singapore (6.58 stops/km²)** has the **highest density**, reflecting  
  its highly planned, fully government-coordinated trunk–feeder system.  
  Singapore’s Land Transport Authority places stops at regular intervals 
  (~200–400 m), creating a uniformly fine-grained bus network optimized 
  for walkability and MRT transfer.

- **Amsterdam (4.7 stops/km²)** also exhibits a **dense stop pattern**,  
  especially within its compact historical core. Its transit system is 
  multi-modal (bus + tram + metro), and bus services supplement tram 
  corridors, producing dense central coverage.

- **Shanghai (3.34 stops/km²)** appears moderate, but the number masks 
  its huge geographic area (6955 km²).  
  Within the dense central districts (Puxi/Pudong), stop spacing is 
  actually very tight, but the municipal boundary includes vast 
  low-density industrial and rural zones, lowering the citywide average.

- **New York City (2.48 stops/km²)** shows the lowest density.  
  NYC buses primarily serve as a surface transit network parallel to the 
  extensive subway system. Additionally, wide arterial blocks—especially 
  in Manhattan and parts of Queens/Brooklyn—naturally result in fewer 
  intersections and therefore fewer stop locations.

### **Key takeaway**

Bus stop density reflects **urban form** and **planning philosophy**, not merely transit supply:

- *Centralised planning → uniform high density (Singapore)*  
- *Historic compactness + multimodal layering → medium high (Amsterdam)*  
- *Very large administrative boundaries → moderate composite density (Shanghai)*  
- *Subway-dominant network → lower bus density (NYC)*

## 2. Density summary table

The table summarises total area, number of stops, and density for each city.

![](../figures/density_summary_table.png)

### **Interpretation**

| City | Area (km²) | Stops | Density (per km²) | Interpretation |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **NYC** | 1362.7 | 3381 | 2.48 | Low density, reflecting subway dominance; buses fill gaps in outer boroughs more than the Manhattan core. |
| **Singapore** | 784.9 | 5161 | 6.58 | National-level planning produces evenly distributed stops and short spacing. |
| **Amsterdam** | 243.7 | 1145 | 4.70 | Small, dense city with complementary tram/bus system. |
| **Shanghai** | 6955.7 | 23229 | 3.34 | High bus supply diluted across enormous urban–rural municipal territory. |

### **Urban-structure explanation**

- **Administrative scale is critical**:  
  Shanghai's area is nearly **30× Amsterdam** but does not have 30× more stops.

- **Modal hierarchy affects bus density**:  
  Cities where buses are *primary transport* (Singapore) naturally build higher stop density than cities where buses provide coverage between rail corridors (NYC).

- **Street pattern differences**:  
  - Grid-like cities (NYC) → fewer intersections per km²  
  - Organic/medieval European cores (Amsterdam) → more intersections → more stop opportunities

## 3. Detailed accessibility indicators

This table reports 500 m coverage, covered area, and nearest-neighbour 
distance statistics for each city.

![](../figures/detailed_accessibility_summary.png)

### **High-level findings**

Despite strong differences in bus stop density, **all four cities achieve 
similar 500 m walking coverage (55–57%)**.  
This is an important insight:  
📌 *High density does not automatically translate into proportionally higher coverage.*

### **Interpretation by metric**

---

### **A. 500m coverage ratio (55–57%)**

| City | Coverage Ratio | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Amsterdam (56.8%)** | Slightly highest due to dense centre and small municipal area—bus stops can reach a large share of the city surface. |
| **NYC (56.1%)** | Despite low stop density, NYC achieves good coverage because built-up land is concentrated and bus routes traverse dense blocks. |
| **Singapore (55.9%)** | Even planning leads to consistent accessibility island-wide. |
| **Shanghai (55.2%)** | Similar coverage, but diluted by massive suburban/rural tracts. |

**Why similar?**  
Large uninhabited land (NYC parks, Shanghai farmland, Amsterdam waterways)  
dilutes the ratio when calculated using *full administrative boundaries*.

Thus, **coverage of populated areas is likely much higher**.

---

### **B. Covered area (km²)**

Unsurprisingly dominated by city size:

- **Shanghai (3840 km²)** dwarfs the others—indicating extensive surface transit.  
- **NYC (764.6 km²)** also large due to long bus corridors through Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn.  
- **Singapore (438.7 km²)** matches its compact island size.  
- **Amsterdam (138.3 km²)** is smallest but proportionally highly accessible.

---

### **C. Nearest-neighbour distance**

This metric reflects **bus stop spacing**, a strong indicator of walkability.

| City | Mean NN Dist (m) | Interpretation |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Amsterdam (63 m)** | Exceptionally short spacing; bus and tram stops form a tight mesh. |
| **Singapore (79 m)** | Short and regular stop spacing consistent with national standards. |
| **Shanghai (91 m)** | Dense inner-city spacing but wider intervals in outer districts. |
| **NYC (183 m)** | Longest spacing; wide blocks and the presence of the subway reduce need for close bus spacing. |

The **90th percentile** values reinforce this pattern:

- **NYC 393 m** → Large variations between dense Manhattan vs. wide Queens/Brooklyn arterials  
- **Amsterdam 134 m**, **Singapore 161 m** → Stable, predictable spacing  
- **Shanghai 201 m** → Reflects mixed urban/suburban structure  

---

### **D. Interpreting the patterns**

- Cities with **integrated multimodal systems** (Amsterdam, Singapore) show  
  **uniformly short nearest-neighbour distances** and fine-grained coverage.

- **NYC’s long NN distances** are a direct function of:
  - subway dominance,
  - large block lengths,
  - a bus system designed for coverage—not fine-grained walkability.

- **Shanghai’s mixed-range NN distances** reflect:
  - highly urbanized districts with dense stops,
  - large exurban areas with coarse spacing.

---

## **Summary of Cross-city Insights**

### **1. High density ≠ high coverage**
All four cities achieve similar 500 m coverage despite large differences in stop density.

### **2. Transit philosophy shapes the network**
- *Singapore*: Regular spacing due to planned trunk–feeder design  
- *Amsterdam*: Tight spacing in compact historic fabric  
- *NYC*: Bus network plays secondary role next to subway  
- *Shanghai*: Municipal boundaries hide large intra-city variation

### **3. Nearest-neighbour distances reveal more than density**
NN distance is a better indicator of street-level accessibility than raw density.
