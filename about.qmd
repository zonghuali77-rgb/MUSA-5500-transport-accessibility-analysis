My name is **Zonghua Li**, and I am a second-year Master’s student in City Planning with a concentration in Smart Cities. This project was developed as part of a Python-based course on geospatial analytics and urban data science.

My academic interests focus on:

- public transport systems and transit-oriented development (TOD),  
- accessibility and spatial equity in cities,  
- applying open data platforms and open-source geospatial tools to urban analysis.

This website represents my final project, where I used Python, GeoPandas, and Quarto to construct an end-to-end analytical workflow that includes:

1. collecting and cleaning spatial datasets from multiple public sources,  
2. implementing reproducible spatial analysis with open-source methods, and  
3. communicating the results through maps, tables, and an interactive website.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how quantitative geospatial analysis can support planning practice—particularly in understanding who can access essential services, how transit networks shape accessibility, and where coverage gaps may emerge.
