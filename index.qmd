# Background and Motivation

Public transport accessibility is a central concern in contemporary
urban planning. A dense and well-distributed bus network can reduce
car dependence, support social equity, and connect residents to jobs,
education, and essential services. At the same time, many large cities
worldwide are facing pressures from rapid urbanisation, climate change,
and increasing socio-spatial inequality. Understanding where bus
services are abundant – and where gaps remain – is therefore both a
technical and a normative question.

This project investigates bus stop accessibility in four major
metropolitan areas:

- **New York City (USA)**  
- **Singapore**  
- **Amsterdam (Netherlands)**  
- **Shanghai (China)**  

Together, these cities span different continents, governance regimes,
urban forms, and data environments. Comparing them side by side allows
us to see how different planning traditions and data infrastructures are
reflected in the spatial patterns of bus service.

# Why These Four Cities?

## City Bus Systems in Context

Although this project focuses on bus stop locations rather than service
operations, it is important to understand the broader context of each
city’s bus system. The brief profiles below summarise key features that
inform the interpretation of the spatial patterns.

### New York City

New York City’s bus network is operated under **MTA Regional Bus
Operations (RBO)**, which consolidates services provided by MTA New York
City Bus and MTA Bus Company. Together they form one of the largest bus
systems in the world, with a fleet of over 5,000 vehicles, more than
300 routes, and many services operating 24/7. The network includes local
stopping routes, limited-stop and express lines, as well as Select Bus
Service corridors that approximate bus rapid transit. Historically
separate operating companies – including several private operators in
Queens and express services from the outer boroughs – have gradually
been integrated into a unified fare and scheduling system. As a result,
the spatial footprint of bus stops reflects both legacy private
franchises and later rationalisation efforts by the MTA.

### Singapore

Singapore’s bus system is **highly structured and formally
categorised**. Routes are differentiated into trunk services linking
major towns, feeder services circulating within neighbourhoods, express
and peak-hour routes that skip lower-demand stops, short-trip variants
of longer lines, special industrial services to Jurong and Tuas,
cross-border services to Malaysia, and a range of niche services such as
Resorts World Sentosa shuttles and privately operated “Scheme B”
routes. Under the **Bus Contracting Model**, services are organised into
packages and competitively tendered to different operators, while the
Land Transport Authority plans the overall network. This institutional
set-up tends to produce relatively systematic spacing of stops and
strong coordination between buses and the MRT network.

### Amsterdam

In Amsterdam, buses **complement an already dense tram and metro
system**. Within the municipality, city buses are mainly operated by
GVB and serve outer neighbourhoods and corridors that are not covered by
tram or metro. Regional bus companies such as Connexxion, EBS, and
Transdev connect Amsterdam with surrounding towns and key visitor
destinations in the wider region (for example the Waterland villages,
Zaanse Schans, and Schiphol Airport). For visitors and commuters, the
Amsterdam & Region Travel Ticket provides integrated access to these
services across operators. The result is a bus stop pattern that is
strongly shaped by inter-operator coordination and the presence of
multiple overlapping modes.

### Shanghai

Shanghai’s bus network is **large, multi-operator, and highly
differentiated**. More than ten bus companies operate roughly 1,600
routes that link the dense central districts with rapidly expanding
suburban areas. Regular urban lines are numbered (roughly from 1 to the
900s), while additional labels distinguish cross-river and tunnel
services, district and suburban routes, night buses, peak-hour express
lines, and local shuttle services designed to solve the “last-kilometre”
connection to metro stations and between major roads and residential
communities. On most inner-city routes, stop announcements are made in
Mandarin, Shanghainese, and English, reflecting the city’s multilingual
context. This complex operational structure contributes to a very dense
but spatially heterogeneous pattern of bus stops.


The cities were selected for three main reasons:

1. **Diverse planning and transit models**

   - **New York City** represents a large, polycentric North American
     metropolis with a long history of high-capacity transit
     (subway, commuter rail) and a dense but uneven bus network.  
   - **Singapore** is a compact city-state with a strongly integrated
     public transport system, where bus routes are carefully coordinated
     with the MRT network and land-use planning.  
   - **Amsterdam** exemplifies a European approach to sustainable
     mobility, with a combination of rail, tram, bus, and high levels of
     walking and cycling.  
   - **Shanghai** is a rapidly developed megacity where metro expansion
     and bus network restructuring have taken place at remarkable speed
     over the last two decades.

   These contrasting contexts offer a natural laboratory for exploring
   how bus stop patterns emerge under different planning paradigms.

2. **Variation in open data and data sources**

   The four cities also differ in how transit and boundary data are made
   available:

   - New York City and Singapore provide rich, curated datasets via open
     data portals.  
   - Amsterdam publishes detailed administrative boundaries, while bus
     stops are obtained from OpenStreetMap.  
   - Shanghai lacks comprehensive official open transit data, so
     OpenStreetMap, via the Overpass API, is used as the main bus stop
     source, and Simplemaps is used for municipal boundaries.

   This mix reflects the reality that urban researchers often rely on a
   combination of official and volunteered geographic information (VGI).

3. **Comparability as large global cities**

   All four are **large, economically significant cities** with
   extensive public transport systems and substantial daily ridership.
   Comparing bus stop accessibility across them therefore speaks to
   broader questions about global urban mobility and spatial justice,
   rather than to small idiosyncratic cases.

# Research Questions and Objectives

The analysis is guided by four main questions:

1. **How dense are bus stop networks in each city?**  
2. **What share of the urban area lies within a walkable distance
   (500 m) of a bus stop?**  
3. **How are bus stops spatially distributed – clustered, even, or
   irregular – as reflected in kernel density surfaces and
   nearest-neighbour distances?**  
4. **How might differences in planning approaches and data environments
   help explain the observed patterns?**

The objectives are:

- To construct a **transparent and reproducible geospatial workflow**
  for analysing bus accessibility using open-source Python tools.  
- To produce **comparable indicators** of bus stop density, walking
  coverage, and spatial regularity across the four cities.  
- To generate **maps and summary statistics** that can support
  discussions on transit equity, network design, and the role of open
  data in urban research.

# Relation to Urban Planning and Policy

Although this is a data-driven exercise, the questions are rooted in
urban planning debates:

- **Equity and inclusion** – who benefits from high levels of bus
  service, and which neighbourhoods remain underserved?  
- **Multimodal integration** – how do bus stop patterns complement or
  duplicate rail and metro networks?  
- **Street and land-use structure** – how do built form and road layout
  shape feasible bus routing and stop spacing?  
- **Data and governance** – how do different open data practices
  facilitate or constrain comparative research?

The results should be read not as a definitive performance ranking of
cities, but as a **spatial diagnostic** that helps planners and
researchers ask better questions about transit provision and access.
