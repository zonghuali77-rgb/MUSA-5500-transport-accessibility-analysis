# 1. Core spatial datasets

These datasets form the backbone of the quantitative analysis
(bus stop density, 500 m coverage and nearest-neighbour distances).

## 1.1 City boundaries

- **New York City**  
  Borough boundaries from **NYC Open Data**  
  (NYC Borough Boundaries; used to define the built-up area of the
  five boroughs).

- **Singapore**  
  Planning area polygons from the **2019 Master Plan** on **data.gov.sg**,  
  aggregated to the national extent.

- **Amsterdam**  
  Administrative areas from **Open GEO-Data Amsterdam**  
  (Gemeente Amsterdam – stadsdelen / neighbourhood boundaries).

- **Shanghai**  
  City boundary from **Simplemaps** (Shanghai polygon extracted from a
  global cities dataset).  
  This polygon includes some non-built-up land and water areas, but is
  used as an approximation of the municipal extent due to the lack of
  free official GIS boundary data.

For Shanghai the analysis additionally focuses on the **main urban
island** (central municipality), excluding the outlying islands
(e.g. Chongming). This corresponds better to the area where dense
urban development and the bus network are concentrated.

## 1.2 Bus stops

- **New York City**  
  **Bus Shelters** dataset from **NYC Open Data**.  
  This represents the locations of bus shelters rather than every
  physical stop pole, but coverage is high and spatially consistent,
  and is therefore used as a proxy for bus stops.

- **Singapore**  
  **Bus Stop Locations** from the **Land Transport Authority (LTA)**
  via **data.gov.sg**, including official stop codes and coordinates.

- **Amsterdam**  
  OpenStreetMap bus stops (`highway=bus_stop`) retrieved via the  
  **Overpass API**. These were clipped to the Amsterdam municipal
  boundary.

- **Shanghai**  
  OpenStreetMap bus stops (`highway=bus_stop`) retrieved via the  
  **Overpass API**, then clipped to the (Simplemaps-based) city
  boundary.

### Data limitations

- OpenStreetMap data (Amsterdam, Shanghai) may miss a small share of
  minor stops, especially in peripheral areas.
- NYC bus shelters under-represent stops without shelters, but capture
  the main passenger hubs and urban corridors.
- The Shanghai boundary is broader than the actual built-up area,
  including river surfaces and some industrial / rural land.
  This is noted explicitly in the Shanghai city profile and should be
  kept in mind when comparing densities across cities.

# 2. Derived indicators

All indicators in the analysis were computed from the datasets above.

- **Area (km²)**  
  Total area of each city’s boundary polygon in a projected CRS.

- **Number of stops**  
  Count of bus stops inside each city boundary.

- **Bus stop density (stops per km²)**  
  Simple ratio of total stops to total area.

- **500 m coverage ratio / area**  
  For each city, 500 m buffers were generated around all stops,
  dissolved into a single coverage polygon and intersected with the
  boundary. The coverage ratio is:

  \[
  \text{coverage} = \frac{\text{area within 500 m of a stop}}{\text{total city area}}
  \]

- **Nearest-neighbour statistics**  
  Using a KDTree on projected coordinates, the distance from each stop
  to its nearest other stop was computed. From this distribution the
  mean, median, 90th percentile, minimum and maximum distances were
  summarised.

- **Kernel density estimation (KDE)**  
  A 2D Gaussian kernel density was fitted to stop locations for each
  city to visualise high- and low-density corridors in the maps.

# 3. Contextual reference maps and images

The project also uses several **illustrative bus maps and photographs**
to provide qualitative context for interpreting the spatial indicators.
These do **not** enter the quantitative calculations, but they help
relate the patterns to each city’s transport system.

## 3.1 Overview page images

- **New York City bus photograph**  
  Image of an MTA bus in service, used on the “Why these four cities?”
  page to illustrate the NYC network.

  pledge”.*

- **Singapore bus network map** (`image/Singapore_Lines.png`)  
  Stylised bus route map produced by the **Land Transport Authority
  (LTA)**, used to show the structure of the island-wide network.

- **Amsterdam bus photograph / schematic** (`image/ams_bus.png`)  
  Image illustrating GVB-operated buses in Amsterdam.

- **Shanghai bus network overview** (`image/Shanghai_Lines.png`)  
  Screenshot of the bus and transit network from **Google Maps Transit
  layer**, cropped to the core urban area.

## 3.2 City profile reference maps

Each city-specific page includes one additional reference map of the
local bus system:

- **New York City – Manhattan bus map**  
  (`image/manhattan-bus-map.png`)  
  Extract from the official **MTA Manhattan Bus Map**, used as a
  high-density reference to explain the strong clustering of stops in
  Manhattan.  
  *Source: Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) – Official
  Manhattan Bus Map.*

- **Singapore – island-wide bus routes**  
  (`image/Singapore_Lines.png`)  
  LTA’s bus route map showing trunk corridors, expressways and
  cross-island links. This helps interpret the KDE results and
  the relatively short nearest-neighbour distances.  
  *Source: Land Transport Authority, Singapore – Bus Route Map.*

- **Amsterdam – GVB bus network**  
  (`image/Amsterdam_Lines.png`)  
  Map of GVB bus lines in greater Amsterdam, highlighting the dense
  radial routes around the historic centre and links to peripheral
  districts such as Bijlmer and Slotervaart.  
  *Source: GVB / Amsterdam bus network map.*

- **Shanghai – Google Transit bus network**  
  (`image/Shanghai_Lines.png`)  
  Google Transit view of Shanghai’s bus network within the main urban
  municipality, showing radial corridors from the inner ring roads
  towards the suburbs and connections to metro and railway hubs.

These contextual materials are cited to acknowledge their origin and to
clarify that they serve only as **visual references**, while all
quantitative results (densities, coverage, nearest-neighbour distances
and KDE surfaces) are based exclusively on the open spatial datasets
listed in Sections 1 and 2.
