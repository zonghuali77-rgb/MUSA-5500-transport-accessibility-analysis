# 1. Bus stops and boundary

![](../figures/sg_bus_stops.png)

Singapore’s bus stops are tightly concentrated within the main urbanised
island.  The stop pattern broadly follows the public housing new towns
from Jurong in the west to Tampines and Pasir Ris in the east, with
particularly dense strings of stops along the north–south and east–west
corridors that parallel the MRT lines.  
Large gaps in the north-west and central part of the island coincide
with the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, military training areas and
low-density industrial land, rather than underserved residential
neighbourhoods.

Compared with New York City, Singapore has fewer extreme peripheral
areas: almost all developable land is within a continuous urban fabric.
This helps explain why Singapore records the highest bus-stop density in
the comparative statistics (about **6.6 stops/km²**), considerably higher
than New York City (~2.5 stops/km²) and somewhat higher than Amsterdam
(~4.7 stops/km²).  The morphology of a compact island city-state with
strong planning control supports a finely spaced stop network.

# 2. 500 m coverage

![](../figures/sg_coverage_500m.png)

The 500 m buffer map shows that most urbanised parts of Singapore fall
within walking distance of at least one bus stop.  The estimated share
of land area covered within 500 m is about **55.9%**, very similar to the
other three cities (roughly 55–57%).  However, because large tracts of
land are reserved for nature, industry or airport uses, the coverage
percentage is not directly comparable to residential accessibility.

Spatially, high coverage is seen:

- along the north-south corridor from Woodlands through Yishun and
  Ang Mo Kio to Toa Payoh;
- across the eastern “HDB heartlands” such as Bedok, Tampines and Pasir
  Ris;  
- in older public housing estates and industrial areas in the west
  (Jurong East/West).

Lower coverage appears in the central water-catchment and military
zones, as well as in some coastal industrial areas.  These are
intentional “holes” in the network rather than service gaps.

Relative to New York City, where coverage drops in low-density fringes
and on barrier islands, Singapore’s coverage map is more contiguous
across the urbanised band.  This reflects the state’s planning goal of
ensuring that almost all public housing estates are within a short walk
of both bus services and the MRT.

# 3. Kernel density heatmap

![](../figures/sg_kde_bw300.png)

The kernel density heatmap reveals several high-intensity ridges of bus
stop concentration:

- a strong east–west band from Jurong East through Clementi and
  Queenstown towards the Central Area;
- a dense cluster in and around the traditional CBD and Orchard corridor;
- high densities in new towns such as Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Bedok,
  Tampines and Pasir Ris.

Compared with the point map, the KDE surface smooths local variation and
highlights broader structural patterns: Singapore’s bus system
concentrates stops along town centres, interchanges and major distributor
roads, with somewhat lower intensities in industrial estates and
exclusive residential enclaves.

When contrasted with New York City’s KDE, Singapore appears more
spatially even: rather than a single dominant spine like Manhattan,
multiple “peaks” related to decentralised new-town centres can be seen.
This is consistent with the transit-oriented land-use strategy in which
each new town has its own bus interchange and commercial core, reducing
the need to funnel all trips through a single CBD.

# 4. Nearest-neighbour distances

![](../figures/sg_nearest_neighbor.png)

The nearest-neighbour analysis quantifies how tightly bus stops are
spaced:

- mean nearest-neighbour distance: **~79.7 m**  
- median distance: **~57.1 m**  
- 90th percentile distance: **~161 m**  
- minimum distance: essentially **0 m** (paired stops or loop
  terminals)  
- maximum distance: **~1.1 km**

The histogram is sharply right-skewed: the majority of stops lie within
100 m of their closest neighbour, indicating a very fine mesh of
services along key corridors.  The spatial map shows slightly larger
distances in industrial areas, expressway segments and some coastal
reclamation zones, where stops are naturally more widely spaced and
pedestrian access is restricted.

Compared with the other cities, Singapore shows:

- **much smaller mean and median distances than New York City**
  (mean ≈ 183 m, median ≈ 108 m), reflecting closer stop spacing in a
  compact urban environment;
- **slightly larger distances than Amsterdam**, where the highly
  walkable inner city and tram-bus integration bring typical distances
  down to around 63 m mean and 39 m median;
- **shorter distances than Shanghai**, where the large metropolitan
  extent and arterial focus of services yield a mean ≈ 91 m and a
  maximum above 1.2 km.

Overall, the nearest-neighbour statistics support the interpretation
that Singapore’s bus network provides very fine local accessibility
within built-up areas, with only a small share of stops experiencing
gaps greater than 200–300 m.

# 5. Context: structure of the Singapore bus network

![](../image/Singapore_Lines.png){width=80%}

*Image source: Land Transport Authority, Singapore – Bus Route Map.*

The official route map helps to interpret the spatial metrics above:

- **Trunk and express routes** form long east–west and north–south
  axes, broadly mirrored in the KDE heatmap’s high-density bands.
- **Feeder services** circulate within each new town, connecting housing
  blocks to bus interchanges and MRT stations; these explain the dense
  local clusters of stops and the short nearest-neighbour distances.
- Under the **Bus Contracting Model**, routes are bundled into service
  packages and competitively tendered, but still centrally planned by
  the Land Transport Authority.  This allows the authority to maintain
  relatively even geographic coverage and regular stop spacing,
  independent of purely commercial considerations.

Placed alongside New York City, Amsterdam and Shanghai, Singapore’s
figures illustrate a particular model of high-intensity bus provision in
a small, centrally governed city-state:

- stop density is the highest among the four cases, consistent with the
  emphasis on public transport as the dominant travel mode;
- 500 m coverage is similar to the others, but this is achieved while a
  large share of land is reserved for non-urban uses, implying
  especially good coverage of *developed* land;
- nearest-neighbour distances are short but not extreme, suggesting a
  balance between walking convenience and operational efficiency.

These patterns reflect policy choices: a strong integration between bus
and rail, systematic provision for HDB estates, and careful control of
urban expansion.  Together they help explain why Singapore’s bus system
achieves both high spatial accessibility and relatively compact urban
form.
