# 1. Bus stops and boundary

![](../figures/ams_bus_stops.png)

Amsterdam’s bus stops are concentrated heavily in the **central urban districts (Centrum, West, Zuid, Oost)**, with an additional secondary cluster around **Amstelveen** in the south. This produces a “multi-core + strip-like” distribution pattern aligned closely with the city’s spatial structure:

- **Historic centre (Centrum)** has dense, irregular street networks, resulting in tightly packed bus stop clusters.
- **Expansion districts (Zuid, West, Nieuw-West)** show more grid-like patterns, reflected in more regular stop spacing.
- **Amstelveen** serves as a major suburban residential and commercial node, forming the second dense cluster.

Compared with New York, Amsterdam lacks an ultra-dense corridor analogous to Manhattan, and instead resembles Singapore’s multi-nodal structure—although overall density is significantly lower due to different urban form and population patterns.

# 2. 500 m coverage

![](../figures/ams_coverage_500m.png)

The 500 m (5–7 minute walking distance) coverage analysis shows:

- **Almost complete coverage across the city centre and Amstelveen**, forming continuous blue buffers.
- **Coverage becomes thinner near the northwest and southwest edges** where natural areas, waterways, and low-density zones dominate.
- **Southern Amstelveen achieves exceptionally continuous coverage**, indicating mature, evenly spaced stop planning.

Across the four cities:

- Amsterdam’s 500 m coverage ratio (**56.8%**) is the **highest** (NYC 56.1%, Singapore 55.9%, Shanghai 55.2%).
- The small city area combined with evenly spaced stops yields high efficiency.
- Singapore also achieves widespread coverage but is constrained by large nature reserves and industrial areas.
- New York is affected by large inter-borough disparities.
- Shanghai’s massive suburban footprint lowers its overall coverage rate.

# 3. Kernel density heatmap

![](../figures/ams_kde_bw250.png)

The KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) reveals Amsterdam’s bus stop density structure:

### **(1) Primary hotspot: Central East–West corridor**
- Strongest KDE intensity.
- Overlaps historic commercial and tourism districts.

### **(2) Secondary hotspots: De Pijp, Oost, western residential districts**
- Appear as plate-like distributions, corresponding to well-developed residential grids.

### **(3) Strong linear hotspot: Amstelveen North–South axis**
- KDE shows a bright linear band.
- Reflects the major commuting corridor connecting Amstelveen with the city centre.

### Cross-city comparison:
- **NYC**: density focuses on a single vertical corridor (Manhattan).
- **Singapore**: wide multi-point density reflecting evenly distributed public housing.
- **Amsterdam**: hybrid between the two—a compact European multi-nodal system with strong centrality but also secondary clusters.

# 4. Nearest-neighbour distances

![](../figures/ams_nearest_neighbor.png)

Amsterdam’s NN (nearest neighbour) analysis reveals:

### **(1) Mean NN = 63 m, the smallest among all four cities**
- Amsterdam: **63.3 m**
- Singapore: 79.7 m  
- Shanghai: 91.3 m  
- New York: 183 m  

This indicates extremely tight spacing, especially in the core districts.

### **(2) NN histogram shows minimal long-tail**
- Majority of stops lie only 30–70 m apart.
- Very few above 200 m.
- Spatial distribution is nearly “hyper-uniform.”

### **(3) Larger NN distances cluster at peripheral zones**
- These correspond to green areas, industrial zones, and low-density edges.

### Cross-city comparison:
- **NYC**: long tail due to borough differences and uneven stop distribution.
- **Singapore**: generally uniform but influenced by terrain and constrained areas.
- **Amsterdam**: **most uniform, tightest spacing**, reflecting pedestrian-oriented European planning traditions.

## 5. Amsterdam bus network (GVB reference)

*Image source: GVB / Amsterdam public transport – Amsterdam Bus Network Map (via Amsterdam Map 360).*

The official Amsterdam bus network map provides functional context not visible in point-based KDE and NN graphs.

### **(1) The city centre forms a “dense transit mesh”**
- Blue bus lines form a grid within the central ring.
- Overlapping routes create high stop density → matches KDE hotspots.
- Unlike NYC’s north–south corridor model (Manhattan), Amsterdam uses a **radial + mesh** pattern.

### **(2) Amstelveen–Centrum corridor stands out clearly**
- Major north–south trunk routes link Amstelveen directly to the central city.
- Aligns with the strong KDE linear hotspot in the south.

### **(3) Peripheral areas adopt ring-shaped or semi-ring connections**
- North and east edges show fewer routes.
- Corresponds with weaker 500 m coverage and larger NN distances.
- These areas have lower population density or serve industrial and waterfront functions.

### How the bus network map complements our spatial metrics:
- KDE/NN show spatial density.
- The lines map reveals **functional connectivity**.
- Combined, they demonstrate that Amsterdam’s network is:
  - **Highly dense in the centre**
  - **Multi-nodal**
  - **Peripheral-light**
  - **A compact, European-style transit system**

# 6. Comparative overview (Amsterdam vs. NYC vs. Singapore vs. Shanghai)

| Indicator | Amsterdam | NYC | Singapore | Shanghai |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mean NN distance | **63 m (lowest)** | 183 m | 79 m | 91 m |
| 500 m coverage | **56.8% (highest)** | 56.1% | 55.9% | 55.2% |
| Stop distribution type | Multi-core + grid | Single core + borough gaps | Territory-wide uniform | Dense centre + enormous suburbs |
| Urban form | Compact European | Large polycentric | All-island national city | Mega-metropolitan |

**Conclusion:**  
### **Amsterdam achieves the highest bus accessibility efficiency among the four cities**  
thanks to compact form, uniform stop spacing, and a dense, walkable transit network—distinct from the large-scale structures of NYC and Shanghai and the suburban-nature hybrid form of Singapore.
